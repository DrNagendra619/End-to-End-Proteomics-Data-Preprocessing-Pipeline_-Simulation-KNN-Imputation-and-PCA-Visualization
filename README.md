## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a complete Python workflow for analyzing **Proteomics data**. The pipeline simulates realistic Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) intensity data, handles missing values (a common issue in proteomics), performs statistical normalization, and utilizes **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

This project is designed to demonstrate best practices in bioinformatics data cleaning and unsupervised machine learning.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Data Simulation:** Generates synthetic proteomics datasets mimicking LC-MS intensities ($100 \times 6$ matrix).
* **Noise Injection:** Simulates realistic data loss (peptide dropouts/low signals) by introducing missing values.
* **Advanced Imputation:** Uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to statistically estimate and fill missing data points based on sample similarity.
* **Normalization Pipeline:**
    * **Log2 Transformation:** To correct skewness and stabilize variance.
    * **Median Normalization:** To center data and correct for technical variations between samples.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Implements **PCA** to reduce noise and visualize sample clustering in 2D space.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python** (Data processing logic)
* **NumPy** (Numerical simulation)
* **Pandas** (Dataframe manipulation)
* **Scikit-Learn** (KNN Imputation, StandardScaler, PCA)
* **Matplotlib** (Data visualization)

## 📂 Workflow Description

The notebook proceeds through the following scientific steps:

1.  **Simulation**: Creates a dataset of 100 proteins across 6 samples with values ranging from 0 to 1,000,000.
2.  **Missing Value Introduction**: Randomly masks 10% of the data as `NaN` to mimic real-world experimental limitations.
3.  **Imputation**: Applies `KNNImputer (k=3)` to retain biological relationships while filling gaps.
4.  **Transformation**: Applies $log_2(x+1)$ to handle the right-skewed nature of MS intensity data.
5.  **Normalization**: Aligns samples to a common baseline using median subtraction.
6.  **Scaling**: Standardizes features (Mean=0, Std=1) to prepare for PCA.
7.  **PCA Visualization**: Projects the 6-dimensional data into 2 Principal Components to reveal underlying structure.

## 📊 Interpreting the PCA Results

The final output of this pipeline is a PCA scatter plot. Here is how to interpret the results generated by the notebook:

* **PC1 & PC2:** These axes represent the directions of maximum variance in the data. They allow us to view high-dimensional data in a simple 2D format.
* **Clustering:** Points that group together indicate samples with similar proteomic profiles.
* **Spread:** The distance between points indicates the degree of biological or technical variation.
